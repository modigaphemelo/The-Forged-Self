                    <p>The resistance is not in the way. The resistance <strong class="forge-accent">is</strong> the way the metal teaches you to strike. Most people see resistance as something to avoid, overcome, or complain about. Forgers see resistance as raw material for shaping. Constraints become design features. Opposition becomes structural reinforcement in the grain.</p>
                    
                    <div class="simple-box fire-bg" style="border-color: rgba(255, 149, 0, 0.3);">
                        <p>When you're shaping something meaningful, you will face resistance. The question isn't whether obstacles will appear, but <strong class="forge-accent">what you'll forge with them</strong>. Every limitation is a creative constraint. Every criticism is tempering feedback. Every failure is data about the metal's true nature.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This is the alchemical shift: converting raw ore (resistance) into tempered steel (materials for shaping).</p>

                    <p>Rigid technique breaks against hard metal. Fluid technique survives. When your forging plan meets the metal's reality, the metal wins. Operant adaptation is strategic fluidity - maintaining core shaping intent while adjusting technique to the metal's response.</p>
